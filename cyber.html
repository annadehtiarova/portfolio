            Security teams face significant challenges in managing large volumes of complex data from multiple, disconnected sources. This leads to inefficiencies in data integration, slow processing speeds, and high storage costs, while limiting their ability to analyze and detect threats quickly. Traditional systems often fail to provide the real-time insights and scalability needed, making it difficult for teams to respond to security incidents in a timely manner.

            We designed a platform that simplified data ingestion from multiple sources using Tenzir Query Language (TQL), making it more accessible through prompt-based assistance and easy-to-navigate documentation for quick reference. Users could run and deploy pipelines, and monitor their state in real time, gaining instant visibility into data flow and performance. Additionally, we introduced data visualization capabilities, enabling users to analyze security data more effectively through interactive charts and graphs.

        <p>I conducted interviews with internal stakeholders, including the founder, engineering manager, and engineers, to tap into their existing knowledge about user needs, workflows, and design preferences. From these discussions, I developed a clear understanding of the key UI features, design goals, and performance requirements. Our goal was to get a basic version of the product to market quickly to start gathering real-world feedback.</p>
        <p>I looked at various interfaces of leading competitors in the cybersecurity data management space to see what they offer, how users experience them and where they could be better. Even though the competition provides powerful and fast search and filtering capabilities, clean and modern UI, and an extensive library of visualization options, I have noticed that in most cases the interface appears overwhelming due to its complexity and the large number of features available, making it difficult for new users to navigate. The UI can also be slow, particularly when handling large datasets.</p>
        <p>Based on the combination of existing knowledge from internal stakeholders, assumptions based on similar products, and industry insights, I created hypothetical user personas.</p>

        <p>I focused on key user stories for the MVP, creating user flow diagrams to map out each interaction and ensure a seamless experience. After a brainstorming session with the product team, I used Figma to create low-fidelity wireframes that outlined the basic structure and UI elements, like navigation and buttons. These wireframes were shared with the team for feedback and iterated upon to refine the layout.

          I also designed Tenzirâ€™s first design system, establishing guidelines for consistency and efficiency across digital products. I then enhanced the wireframes with detailed design elements, added annotations for clarity, and created interactive prototypes. These prototypes were refined based on feedback and usability testing to ensure a user-centric, functional design.</p>

        <p>Creating the MVP for Tenzir was a rewarding and insightful experience. Despite limited direct user research, I relied on internal stakeholder interviews and their industry expertise to identify core needs and pain points. Collaborative brainstorming sessions and iterative feedback loops were crucial in refining our ideas and aligning our vision. Developing interactive prototypes allowed us to test and validate assumptions, ensuring a functional, intuitive, and user-centric design. This project emphasized the importance of flexibility, effective communication, and iterative design in creating a successful MVP. It enhanced my skills and deepened my understanding of designing complex data management tools.</p>
